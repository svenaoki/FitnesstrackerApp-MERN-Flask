--- Temporary description ---

This is a MERN Stack project.
MERN stands for mongoDB, Express, ReactJS and nodeJS and is a common stack for front and backend developement. 
The stack is also coupled with a small python model that is a linear regression model which predicts calories based on heart rate, body tempereature and duration of the exercise. Nothing fancy, I only wanted to see how easy it is to integrate the model where I used Flask.
